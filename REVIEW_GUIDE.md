# Review Guide

This is my first time Quarkus code writing. So there are many potential improvement scope available in my opinion.
I tried to cover all the requirements and also tried to implement some of the best practices.
I added some tests but wasn't able to cover everything due to time constraint. One important topic that isn't covered by the unit tests are data validation. But, I tried to cover the crucial business logic.

### Tech Used
 - Quarkus
 - Java
 - H2

I kept some TODO marked. These are the areas that I would like to improve if I had more time.

You can find the instruction to run the application in the README.md file.

Please feel free to ask any questions.
